## Summary
This application utilizes third-party APIs in order to retrieve
weather data for cities. When you search for a city within the search bar, current and future weather conditions are displayed, as well as the city name, the date, icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The UV index is also color coordinated to indicate whether the conditions are favorable or unfavorable. A 5-day forecast is also displayed.
